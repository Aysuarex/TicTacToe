## About The Game üéÆ

There are two Modes to choose from:
1. Single Player Mode (against the computer)
2. Multi-player Mode (against a friend)

## How It Works :rocket:

### Single Player Mode
* The player is asked to make a choice between X and O. The player's choice is 
  then recorded and computer is automatically given the second choice.
* The program draws the Tictactoe board and the player is asked to select a 
 position to place their mark (X or O).
* Then the computer also places its token in one of the remaining spaces, after 
  which the player is then asked to play again.
* The first player to arrange three of their marks on a straight line across the board
   then wins the game.

### Multiplayer Mode

* There are two players and the first player is asked to make a choice between
  X and O. The player's choice is then recorded and the other player is automatically 
  given the second choice.
* The program draws the Tictactoe board and the players are asked to select a 
 position to place their mark (X or O).
* The first player to arrange three of their marks on a straight line across the board
   then wins the game.
