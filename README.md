# TicTacToe  ‚ùå.‚≠ï

# Introduction :eyes: 
This is a cool two-player game of Tictactoe made in C language.

## How It works :rocket:

* There are two players and the first player is asked to make a choice between X and O. The player's choice is then recorded and the other player is automatically given the second choice.
* The program draws the Tictactoe board and the players are asked to select a position to place their mark (X or O). 
* The first player to arrange three of their marks on a straight line across the board then wins the game.

Later versions of this project will feature a "Play against Computer" Mode üéä
